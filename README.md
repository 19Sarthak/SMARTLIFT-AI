The primary focus of this project is to create a robust machine learning model capable of recognizing and
counting repetitions for five key barbell exercises: the bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, and barbell
row. Each of these exercises presents unique movement dynamics and biomechanical considerations, making
them ideal candidates for advanced analysis. For instance, the bench press involves horizontal pushing
movements, while squats require vertical loading and stabilization. The deadlift incorporates both pulling
mechanics and hip hinge patterns, and the overhead press demands shoulder stability and core engagement. 

The barbell row, on the other hand, emphasizes pulling strength and back engagement. By understanding these
nuances, the machine learning model can be trained to accurately identify each exercise, even in the presence of
variability due to individual differences in technique.

The proposed system will provide real-time feedback to users, offering insights such as the number of repetitions
completed, the weight lifted, and the overall workout duration. This feedback loop will not only enhance user
engagement but also empower individuals to make informed adjustments to their training regimens. For example,
if a user consistently performs a particular exercise with improper form, the system can alert them to potential
risks, thereby promoting safer workout practices.
